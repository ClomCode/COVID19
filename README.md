# COVID19

A project completed for SQL and Tableau practice.

It uses data about COVID19 obtained from the Our World In Data dataset found at https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data.

SQL is used to make queries at the dataset so they can be later visualised using Tableau.

The dashboard can be found at https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID19Dashboard_16649054242860/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
